# Understanding Attention Mechanisms in Transformers

## Introduction

Today I explored attention mechanisms, which are a fundamental component of modern transformer-based language models. Attention allows models to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output.

## Key Concepts

### Self-Attention

Self-attention allows the model to consider relationships between all words in a sequence. The basic formula is:

Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax((QK^T)/âˆšd_k)V

Where:
- Q (Query), K (Key), and V (Value) are matrices derived from the input
- d_k is the dimension of the keys (used for scaling)
- softmax converts the result to a probability distribution

### Multi-Head Attention

Rather than performing a single attention function, transformers use multiple attention heads in parallel:

1. Each head has its own set of learned parameters
2. This allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces
3. The outputs of all heads are concatenated and transformed

## Implementation Example

Here's a simplified implementation of self-attention in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, heads):
        super(SelfAttention, self).__init__()
        self.embed_size = embed_size
        self.heads = heads
        self.head_dim = embed_size // heads
        
        assert (self.head_dim * heads == embed_size), "Embed size must be divisible by heads"
        
        self.values = nn.Linear(self.head_dim, self.head_dim, bias=False)
        self.keys = nn.Linear(self.head_dim, self.head_dim, bias=False)
        self.queries = nn.Linear(self.head_dim, self.head_dim, bias=False)
        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(heads * self.head_dim, embed_size)
        
    def forward(self, values, keys, query, mask=None):
        N = query.shape[0]
        value_len, key_len, query_len = values.shape[1



Why Attention Matters
Attention mechanisms solve the problem of capturing long-range dependencies in sequences. Before transformers, recurrent models like LSTMs struggled with this. Attention allows:

Direct connections between any two positions in a sequence
Parallel computation (unlike sequential RNNs)
Interpretable attention weights showing which parts of input the model focuses on

Next Steps
My next exploration will focus on positional encodings in transformers and how they complement attention mechanisms.
