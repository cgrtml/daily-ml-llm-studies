First, draft a bullet-point outline of the key points I should include\n2. Based on the outline, write a first draft of the email\n3. Improve the draft by making the language more engaging and professional\n4. Finally, add a compelling subject line\n\nThe purpose of the meeting is to present our new marketing analytics platform. The client is a mid-sized retail company that has expressed interest but is concerned about implementation complexity.",
