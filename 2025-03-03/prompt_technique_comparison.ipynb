Unlike classical bits that exist as either 0 or 1, quantum bits or 'qubits' can exist in a superposition of states. This property allows quantum computers to explore multiple solutions simultaneously, potentially solving certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. Recent advancements include Google's claim of quantum supremacy in 2019, where their 53-qubit Sycamore processor performed a specific task in 200 seconds that would take the world's most powerful supercomputer approximately 10,000 years. However, challenges remain, including quantum decoherence—the loss of quantum information due to environmental interaction—and high error rates. Researchers are developing quantum error correction methods and more stable qubit designs. Potential applications include cryptography, optimization problems, drug discovery, and material science simulations. While practical, fault-tolerant quantum computers are likely years away, investments from major technology companies and governments worldwide signal strong confidence in the technology's future impact.\",\n",
